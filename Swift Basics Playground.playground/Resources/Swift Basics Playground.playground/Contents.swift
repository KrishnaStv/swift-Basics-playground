//Inheritance
/**
 A class can inherit methods, properties, and other characteristics from another class. When one class inherits from another, the inheriting class is known as a subclass, and the class it inherits from is known as its superclass. Inheritance is a fundamental behavior that differentiates classes from other types in Swift.
 
 
 multiple inheritance is a standard feature of some programming languages, like C++, it is not the case for Swift. In Swift a class can conform to multiple protocols, but inherit from only one class.

//Protocols
/**
 A protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be adopted by a class, structure, or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to conform to that protocol.
 
protocol FullyNamed {
    var fullName: String { get }
}

struct Person: FullyNamed {
    var fullName: String
}
let john = Person(fullName: "John Appleseed")
 
protocol RandomNumberGenerator {
    func random() -> Double
}

class LinearCongruentialGenerator: RandomNumberGenerator {
    func random() -> Double {
        return 100
    }
}

    init(someParameter: Int)
}

class SomeClass: SomeProtocol {
    required init(someParameter: Int) {

//Delegation
/**
 Delegation is a design pattern that enables a class or structure to hand off (or delegate) some of its responsibilities to an instance of another type. This design pattern is implemented by defining a protocol that encapsulates the delegated responsibilities, such that a conforming type (known as a delegate) is guaranteed to provide the functionality that has been delegated.


//protocol --- to send data of menu index click to any Class
protocol PerformMenuActionDelegate: AnyObject {
    func perfromMenuaction(index: Int)
}

// Menu UI ----- we can reuse this Menu for number of screens...
class MenuClass {
    
    weak var delegate: PerformMenuActionDelegate? //associate the delegate
    
    init () {
        
        // after some chceks
        // on click on any index
        delegate?.perfromMenuaction(index: 1) //send delegation to the main class
    }
}


class HomeVC { // one tab of home contains menu
    
    var menuObject = MenuClass() // declar menuobject,
    
    init ()
    {
        // add menu to the view and assign delegate to self, means that if any action perform on the menu that action needs to send back to homeVC
        menuObject.delegate = self
    }
}

// when ever we add delegation to the class, we need to implement that particular protocol
extension HomeVC: PerformMenuActionDelegate { //using extension implementing the protocol, automatically the methods will suggest
    func perfromMenuaction(index: Int) {
        
    }
}

//A protocol can inherit one or more other protocols and can add further requirements on top of the requirements it inherits. The syntax for protocol inheritance is similar to the syntax for class inheritance, but with the option to list multiple inherited protocols, separated by commas:
protocol SomeProtocol {
    
}
protocol InheritingProtocol: SomeProtocol, PerformMenuActionDelegate {
    // protocol definition goes here
}

 */

//Generics
/**
 
 Generic code enables you to write flexible, reusable functions and types that can work with any type, subject to requirements that you define. You can write code that avoids duplication and expresses its intent in a clear, abstracted manner.

print("someInt is now \(someInt), and anotherInt is now \(anotherInt)")

//The generic version of the function uses a placeholder type name (called T, in this case) instead of an actual type name (such as Int, String, or Double). The placeholder type name doesn‚Äôt say anything about what T must be, but it does say that both a and b must be of the same type T, whatever T represents.

// ARC
/**
 Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to track and manage your app‚Äôs memory usage. In most cases, this means that memory management ‚Äújust works‚Äù in Swift, and you don‚Äôt need to think about memory management yourself. ARC automatically frees up the memory used by class instances when those instances are no longer needed.

// Dead lock
/**
 However, it‚Äôs possible to write code in which an instance of a class never gets to a point where it has zero strong references. This can happen if two class instances hold a strong reference to each other, such that each instance keeps the other alive. This is known as a strong reference cycle.

//Closures
/**
 A strong reference cycle can also occur if you assign a closure to a property of a class instance, and the body of that closure captures the instance. This capture might occur because the closure‚Äôs body accesses a property of the instance, such as self.someProperty, or because the closure calls a method on the instance, such as self.someMethod(). In either case, these accesses cause the closure to ‚Äúcapture‚Äù self, creating a strong reference cycle.
